    question: "What is OpenBill? How does it work?",
    answer:
      "OpenBill SG is a platform that aims to bridge the gap between the ineffectiveness associated with the use of informal social media platform for active citizenship and the lack of accessibility associated with formal government platforms. As an independently-produced product, OpenBill lets users submit two types of carefully structured proposals (OpenQuestions and OpenBills) to facilitate the expression of their ideas as policy discourse. Note that OpenBill is not a petition site. The format of these propsals echo instruments used in Parliament, and were made after learning about MP teams' feedback-gathering pain points. These proposals can then be viewed by MP teams or policymaking departments. Aside from Proposals, OpenBill also hosts writing in the form of articles, striving to create a rich community of thinkers striving for genuine impact.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the different types of proposals?",
    answer:
      "OpenBill SG offers proposals in two flavours: OpenQuestions and the namesake, OpenBills. An OpenQuestion is a more accessible format, modelled after Parliamentary Questions. This lets individuals zero in on a single thread of a topic. For those with more knowledge, experience, or simply more thoughts, there exists OpenBill. Modelled after parliamentary Bills, white papers and reports presented to parliament, it offers the structure for one to present cohesive and detailed arguments, explanations or recommendations on a extensive variety of issues.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do MPs or policymakers see my Proposals?",
    answer:
      "While we cannot guarantee that policymakers will see every proposal that is posted, OpenBill exists to bring individuals and policymaking teams closer together. This is also one of the reasons for the upvotes feature in place. Besides, you can be assured that, internally, the OpenBill team will be trying their best to have feedback from OpenBill viewed by the appropriate parties periodically!",
