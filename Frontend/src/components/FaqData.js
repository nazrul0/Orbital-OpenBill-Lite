    question: "What is OpenBill? How does it work?",
    answer:
      "OpenBill SG is a platform that aims to bridge the gap between the ineffectiveness associated with the use of informal social media platform for active citizenship and the lack of accessibility associated with formal government platforms. As an independently-produced product, OpenBill lets users submit two types of carefully structured proposals (OpenQuestions and OpenBills) to facilitate the expression of their ideas as discourse. Note that OpenBill is not a petition site. The format of these propsals echo instruments used in Parliament, and were made after learning about MP teams' feedback-gathering pain points. These proposals can then be viewed by MP teams or policymaking departments. Aside from Proposals, OpenBill also hosts writing in the form of articles, striving to create a rich community of thinkers striving for genuine impact.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the different types of proposals?",
    answer:
      "OpenBill SG offers proposals in two flavours: OpenQuestions and the namesake, OpenBills. An OpenQuestion is more accessible, modelled after Parliamentary Questions. This lets individuals focus on a single thread in an issue. For those with more knowledge, experience, or more to elaborate, there exists the OpenBill. Modelled after parliamentary Bills, and reports presented to parliament, it offers the space for one to present more detailed arguments, explanations or recommendations. Find links to an example of a real parliamentary question or bill at the bottom of the Proposal creation form.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do MPs or policymakers see my Proposals?",
    answer:
      "While we cannot guarantee that policymakers will have the time to see every proposal, OpenBill exists to narrow the gulf between individuals and policymaking teams. You can be assured that, internally, the OpenBill team will be trying their best to have feedback from OpenBill viewed by the appropriate parties! Use the upvotes feature to mark proposals that should get more attention. If an MP team deems follow-up necessary, OpenBill administrators will contact the author via their provided email",
